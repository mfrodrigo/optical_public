Numerical routines for the paper 'Wideband Semiconductor Optical Amplifier Steady-State Numerical Model' by Michael J. Connelly, IEEE Journal
Quantum Electron, vol. 37, no. 3, pp.439-447, 2001.

Author: M. Connelly, University of Limerick, Ireland.

(1) constants - universal and SOA constants (material and geometry)
(2) simul_params  - numerical algorithm parameters
(3) nilsson - approximations to quasi-Fermi levels for conduction and valence bands
(4) SOA_op - SOA operating point simulation, gain, total noise and output spectrum for a single bias current. Multiple signals possible.
(5) SOA_vsbias - SOA simulations versus bias current at a particular input signal power. One signal only.
(6) SOA_vsPower - SOA simulations versus input power at a particular bias current. One signal only.

Useful plotting routines

(1) pqFermi  - plot quasi_Fermi levels versus carrier density
(2) pgain_coeff - plot gain coefficient spectrum
